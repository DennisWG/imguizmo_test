# Minimal reproducible example of ImGuizmo not working properly
This repository to exist in showcasing a bug I've encountered while using [ImGuizmo](https://github.com/CedricGuillemet) ([the issue](https://github.com/CedricGuillemet/ImGuizmo/issues/192)).

You can find the relevant code inside `main.cpp` inside the functions `render_viewport` and `render`.
While the former only renders 2 ImGui panels for you to play around with, the latter is responsible for rendering a cube to a framebuffer and then displaying said framebuffer inside a "viewport panel".
It also displays the ImGuizmo's gizmo.

You can freely move and look around in the 3d space using the following keys:
* WASD - move forward/left/backward/right
* Q/E - move up/down
* hold right mouse - rotate the camera

I truly hope this helps in pinpointing this annoying little bug!
